# Real-Time Chat App

## Overview
Create an interactive web-based messaging platform that enables real-time conversations between multiple users in themed chat rooms. This intermediate-level challenge focuses on implementing real-time data synchronization, user authentication, and an engaging chat experience.

## Goal
Build a web application that simulates the experience of instant messaging with room-based conversations, message history, and interactive elements to enhance communication.

## Required Features
- **User authentication**: Implement a simple login/registration system (username/password or social login)
- **Chat rooms**: Allow users to create, join, and leave different chat rooms
- **Real-time messaging**: Create a system where messages appear instantly for all participants in a room without page refresh
- **Message history**: Display conversation history when users join a room or log back in
- **User presence**: Show a list of participants in chat rooms
- **Responsive design**: Ensure the application works well on desktop and mobile browsers

## Technical Requirements
- Implement WebSocket-like functionality (can be simulated with polling if needed)
- Messages should appear for all participants within 500ms of sending
- Interface should update dynamically as users join/leave or send messages
- All user preferences and message history should persist between sessions

## Deliverables
- GitHub repository with complete source code
- README with setup instructions and feature overview
- 3 ~ 10 screenshots showcasing different app states
- Description of technical decisions and challenges overcome
- (Optional) Link to a YouTube video for a short demo (30 seconds ~ 2 minutes)
- (Optional) Link to the application

## Bonus Ideas (Optional)
- Typing indicators to show when someone is composing a message
- Send an invitation to another user
- Private messaging between users
- More message feature other than plain texts such as images, videos, emojis, etc
